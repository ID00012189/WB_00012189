# CW2 Web Development 00012189

Here we were required to create a dynamic we page with its functions such as deleting, editing, reading and updating. So I have created the logic of the ticket request system using the web programming module materials and notes. So the logic is consist of the following: creating a ticket request with title and its notes. On the boottom there is a status of the ticket rejected or accepted(done or undone). 

So Structure of the website is quite simple and I works simple as well. I used a .json database to save all data created  by user. Also the whole work is uploaded on the github and hosting website.
